Request path in the API (production foundation):

```
request -> BodySizeLimitMiddleware -> AuthenticatedRoute (API key -> tenant, BEFORE the body is parsed)
        -> persist Analysis(running) + raw docs via StorageProvider      [db/, storage/; tenant-scoped]
        -> sandbox worker process: ingest -> extract -> rules -> evidence  [sandbox/; time+memory bounded]
        -> mark Analysis succeeded|failed (+ result JSON)                  [tenant-scoped repository]
```

## Modules (`src/freight_recovery/`)
| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `models.py` | pydantic v2 domain types; money is `Decimal`; `Finding`, `RecoveryResult`, `EvidencePacket` |
| `config.py` | env-driven `Settings` (`FR_*`), secrets excluded from `repr`, `validate_for_production()` guard |
| `keys.py`, `auth.py` | API-key format/HMAC hashing; `AuthenticatedRoute` resolves the tenant from the key before the body is read (401 no key / 403 invalid) |
| `admin.py` | operator CLI: tenants and API keys (`python -m freight_recovery.admin`) |
| `db/` | SQLAlchemy 2 tables (`tables.py`), tenant-bound `AnalysisRepository` and unscoped `TenantAdminRepository` (`repository.py`), engine/session factories, Alembic migrations (`migrations/`, `migrate.py`) |
| `storage/` | `StorageProvider` interface: `LocalFilesystemStorage` (default), `S3Storage` stub behind two flags; tenant-prefixed keys built only from validated ids |
| `sandbox/` | `run_isolated` / `SandboxRunner`: one worker subprocess per job with wall-clock, memory, CPU and output limits and a clean environment; `targets.analyze` is the analysis job |
| `ingest/` | decode PDF (pdfplumber, lazy import) / CSV (flattened to `Key: Value`) / TXT; classify doc type; sha256 |
| `extraction/` | `ExtractionProvider` Protocol; `DeterministicStubProvider` (default, offline); `LLMExtractionProvider` placeholder; `extract_bundle` |
| `rules/` | `detention.py` (auditable calculation), `invoice_checks.py` (rate/fuel/accessorial/duplicate/total), `engine.py` (perspective totals) |
| `evidence/` | `letter.py` deterministic draft letter; `packet.py` assembles packet and markdown |
| `pipeline.py` | `run_pipeline(files, perspective)` - the single orchestration entry point |
| `api/main.py` | `create_app()` factory + `app`; authenticated routes, tenant-scoped persistence, gated docs; `cli.py` for local use (no auth/DB) |

## Key decisions
- **Provider interface, deterministic default.** The pipeline depends only on `ExtractionProvider`. The stub makes tests reproducible and offline; a hosted-model provider can be added without touching rules or evidence. Model output must be validated by pydantic and never trusted for arithmetic: **all money math is in `rules/`, in Decimal.**
- **Rules produce explainable findings.** Every finding carries rule id, amount, confidence, and a step-by-step calculation; uncertain ones set `needs_human_review`. Duplicates are removed before rate comparisons to avoid double counting.
- **Two perspectives, one engine.** Findings are directional (`overcharge` vs `underbilled`); the chosen perspective sums its direction and reports the rest as ignored.
- **Human in the loop.** Output is a draft packet; nothing is sent. Every packet carries a disclaimer.
- **Tenant isolation by construction.** The tenant comes only from the API key. `AnalysisRepository` is bound to one tenant at construction and every query filters on it; another tenant's id is a 404; storage keys carry the tenant prefix and are re-checked on read. PostgreSQL row-level security is the next layer of defense in depth.
- **Persistence behind a repository.** SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic; SQLite locally/tests, PostgreSQL (RDS) in production. An `analyses` row is both the job record (queued/running/succeeded/failed) and the result, so an async worker can adopt it without a schema change. Money is stored as integer cents plus the exact packet JSON.
- **Bounded parsing.** Hostile input is parsed in a separate, resource-limited worker process, never in the API process. This is process isolation, not an OS sandbox; seccomp/read-only-rootfs/no-egress containment is a deployment-layer control (`deploy/aws.md`).
- **No queue yet.** Analyses run synchronously within the request (bounded by the worker pool and a 503 back-pressure); an async job queue is a next step for large documents.
- **Evidence integrity.** Original-bytes sha256 recorded per document.

## Forecasting (roadmap)
`forecast/` is an optional, future capability (not in the core flow): a `Forecaster` interface, a stdlib seasonal-naive/moving-average baseline (default, tested), and a lazily-imported `neuralforecast` backend behind the `[forecast]` extra, off by default and not validated (needs real multi-series data; often only ties baselines). No accuracy claims. `ARCHITECTURE.no.md` pending.

## Known gaps
Scanned-PDF OCR; multi-document/multi-stop loads; timezone-aware timestamps; contract/tariff-specific rules; carrier-specific charge codes; dispute deadlines and status tracking; integrations (TMS/EDI/carrier portals); payments/credit reconciliation; rate limiting, malware scanning, retention policy, an async job queue; and the external security audit / compliance sign-off. The project's research plan (eval set first, independent verifier, measured pass^k) lives in `technical/` and is not yet implemented here.
